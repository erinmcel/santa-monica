        <p class=".resize"> <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size:15px">This map depicts all no-fault evictions</span> from 1997-2013 filed at the Rent Board, including Ellis Act Evictions, Owner-Move-In Evictions, and Demolition Evictions. It does not encapsulate the true level of displacement because buyouts, eviction threats, and rent increases that drive tenants with no rent protection out cumulatively do not show up on official city records. The number of renters evicted per unit is also unknown. Some people also self-evict either because they don’t understand their rights or do not want to fight even against an illegal eviction. These also do not appear here. We are collecting such information through our <a href="http://antievictionmappingproject.wordpress.com/survey/">survey here</a>. </p>

        <p class=".resize">In 1998 the loopholes for owner-move-in (OMI) evictions were altered via a ballot measure. As our <a href="http://antievictionmappingproject.wordpress.com/no-fault-eviction-timeline/">timeline of no-fault evictions shows</a>, they had been wildly abused before that. Now only one owner is allowed  to move into a building and they must live there for three years before they can re-rent. A building that has evicted either a senior with ten plus years of tenancy and/or a disabled tenant can never become a condo. Due to public pressure, there is now a ten year waiting period for condo converstion if the <a href="http://www.antievictionmappingproject.net/ellis.html">Ellis Act</a> was used. Public pressure and local legislation can make a difference during speculative booms.</p>

        <p>
        <strong>Remember, as a tenant you have rights and should receive compensation if being evicted.</strong> Your landlord cannot simply declare, “You are evicted,” or, "I'm moving in." If you are served a notice, quickly seek help at a tenants organization, such as the <a href="http://www.sftu.org">San Francisco Tenants Union</a>, the <a href="http://www.hrcsf.org">Housing Rights Committee</a>, the <a href="http://www.thclinic.org">Tenderloin Housing Clinic</a>, <a href="http://www.cjjc.org/en/services/tenant-services">Causa Justa</a>, or the <a href="http://www.chinatowncdc.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=57&Itemid=67">Chinatown Community Development Center</a>. You can also join an eviction defense direct action group such as <a href="http://evictionfreesf.org">Eviction Free San Francisco</a>. </p>

There are multiple ways that you can get involved. We will soon be holding a hackathon for community members to join us in mapping and researching. If you have been evicted or forced out by other means, please fill out <a href="http://antievictionmappingproject.wordpress.com/survey/">our survey here to put your story on a comprehensive map in the making</a>. </p>
        
        <p><strong>Notes on this map:</strong> The no-fault eviction data that we have used to compile this map comes from the San Francisco Rent Board and San Francisco Planning Department. You can scroll over each explosion to read the address and the number of units displaced.</p>
